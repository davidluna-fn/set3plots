Set3 Plots
=============

Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to install SciencePlots is by using `pip`:

```bash
# to install the lastest release (from PyPI)
pip install set3plots

# to install the latest commit (from GitHub)
pip install git+https://github.com/...

# to clone and install from a local copy
git clone https://github.com/...
cd folder
pip install -e .
```

The pip installation will automatically move all of the Matplotlib style files `*.mplstyle` into the appropriate directory on your computer.
